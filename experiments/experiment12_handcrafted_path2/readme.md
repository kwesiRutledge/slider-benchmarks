# Experiment 12: Handcrafted Path #2

In this experiment, we will attempt to make the pusher slider follow
a hand crafted path where we have 
velocity inputs and sticking contact.

## Conclusion

Cancelled this experiment.

Although it might give more intuitive inputs, it would not fit the dynamics 
structure that we're interested in using.
