# Experiment 10: Homebrewed Trajopt1

This experiment is a homebrewed version of the Trajopt1 algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in the `trajopt1.py` file. The algorithm is a simple gradient descent algorithm that minimizes the cost function.

After the failure of my `trajax` experiments, I returned to my custom trajectory optimizer.

## Conclusions
Although this is more likely to work than other methods, it looks like my method doesn't have a neat way of handling input constraints.
